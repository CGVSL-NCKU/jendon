AR-SA">We describe a low-cost 3-D virtual colonoscopy system that is a 
non-invasive technique to examine the entire colon, and can assist the 
physicians in detecting polyps inside the colon. Using the helical CT data and 
proposed techniques, we can 3D reconstruct and visualize the inner surface of 
the colon. We generate high resolution of video views of the colon interior 
structures as if the viewer’s eyes were inside the colon. The physicians can 
virtually navigate inside the colon in two different modes: interactive and 
automatic navigation, respectively. For the automatic navigation, the flythrough 
path is determined <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a 
priori</i></b> using the 3D thinning and two-pass tracking schemes. The whole 
colon is spatially subdivided into several cells, and only potentially visible 
cells are taken into account during rendering. To further improve rendering 
efficiency, potentially visible cells are rendered at different levels of 
detail. Additionally, a chain of bounding volume in each cell is used to avoid 
penetrating through the colon during navigating. In comparison with the previous 
work, the proposed system can efficiently accomplish the required preprocessing 
tasks, and afford adequate rendering speeds on the low-cost PC system.</span></p>
