<p class="MsoNormalIndent" style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:normal"><span lang="EN-US">Medical scanning instruments such   
as computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide a   
series of cross sectional images of human body. In general, the number of   
available 2D image slices is usually insufficient and therefore, the appropriate   
interpolation methods are usually exploited to estimate missing slices between   
available image slices. Among previous methods, the shape-based method is very   
efficient in implementation and achieves reasonable interpolation results, so it   
has become a widely used method. However, the shaped-based method does not   
consider the global-geometric changes in shape of the object; thus, it cannot   
deal effectively with objects with holes, large offsets, or heavy invagination.   
In this paper, we propose to add several features to control the interpolation   
of shape-based method. Guided by these extra features, the shape-based method   
becomes more powerful and it can handle well more general cases for   
interpolation of medical images that may include complex problems such as the   
branching, hollow, and invagination.</span></p>
