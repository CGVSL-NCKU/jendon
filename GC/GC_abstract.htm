    <td width="100%"><span lang="EN-US">In medical applications,  
      three-dimensional volume data such as CT and MRI are gathered from  
      medical-imaging devices. Marching cube (MC) algorithm is a common routine  
      to extract isosurfaces from volume data. The MC algorithm generates the  
      massive number of triangles to represent an isosurface. It is difficult to  
      render this amount of triangles in real-time on general workstations. In  
      this paper, we present a growing-cube algorithm to reduce the number of  
      triangles generated by the MC algorithm. Growing-cube algorithm uses a  
      surface tracker to avoid exhaustive searching isosurfaces cell by cell and  
      therefore it saves computation time. During surface tracking, the  
      growing-cube algorithm adaptively merges surfaces contained in the tracked  
      cells to reduce the number of triangles. Surfaces are merged as long as  
      the error is within user-specified error thresholds. Therefore, the  
      proposed algorithm can generate a variable resolution of isosurfaces  
      according to these error parameters.<span style="mso-spacerun:
